# KITTI-CARLA: a KITTI-like dataset generated by CARLA Simulator
Python scripts to generate the KITTI-CARLA dataset (see [our article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00892.pdf))

Tested on Windows 10 with CARLA 0.9.10 in ```C:/CARLA_0.9.10/WindowsNoEditor```

The full dataset can be downloaded **[here](https://npm3d.fr/kitti-carla)**.
 

# Installation

```
> git clone https://github.com/jedeschaud/kitti_carla_simulator
```

# Running the data generation
```
Launch CarlaUE4
> python KITTI_data_generator.py #run the generation of a KITTI-like vehicule in the 7 basic maps of CARLA
```

# Creating complete point clouds with the ground truth trajectory
```
> python KITTI_georeferencing.py #create the georefenced point cloud from LiDAR scans and ground truth trajectory
```

# Creating complete colored point clouds
```
> python KITTI_colorization.py #create the colored point cloud from complete point clouds and images
```
